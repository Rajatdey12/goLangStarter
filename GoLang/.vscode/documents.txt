To run go mainfile : -- go run filename.go
To setup debug mode : --- 
1. Install delve project go get github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv

2. Make sure you have Go installed and it is located by VS Code. 
    Open up the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P) and run Go: Locate Configured Go Tools.
    Navigate to the extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X / Cmd+Shift+X) and search for "Go". (publisher is golang.Go).


3. The VS Code extension supports Intellisense, code navigation, debugging, testing, and shows build, lint, vet diagnostics in detail.

    Next you'll need to install the dlv tool for vs code itself.

    Open up Command Palette now (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P) and select Go: Install/Update Tools then search/select dlv.
    Once you have this, you are ready to start debugging!

    Open up the package main or test file you want to debug. 
    Open up the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P / Cmd+Shift+P) and select Debug: Start Debugging then select Go. 
    This will start things up and hit your breakpoints as you would expect.

4.  Create a Go module to run your package :
        go mod init example.com/main
    Then run 
        go mod tidy

5.  To get started with debugging, we need to create a configuration. (launch.json) 
    Click on the Debug Icon (play with bug) on the left pane of Visual Studio Code.
    Next, click on the Gear Icon to create a configuration.
